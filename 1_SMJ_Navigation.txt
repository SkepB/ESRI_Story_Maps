*Story Map - Journal Navigation

*Setup
When creating the shapefile/feature include a field that will tell the story map which section to jump to.
it is possiable to use the ID of the feature, but that means you miss one due to the numbering of the features starting at 0.

The SMJ (Story Map - Journal) has the sections listed like this:
0 = Home
1 = First section
2 = Second section
....and so on

*Finding the relevent ids
[map id]
To find the [map id] simply open the map in portal and look in the address bar of the page.
It will be something like "appid=98347aueua73287494aufd"
Copy the number (98347aueua73287494aufd) and replace [map id] in the code with the copied number as shown below.
--There are no brackets around this number--

[layer id]
open the story map and then the developer console (f12 in Crome and IE)
copy "app.maps.[map id].response.map._layers" and paste it into the dev console, replacing [map id] with your map id
hit enter
you should have a list of layers, find the right one by looking through each _layer and finding the "name".
Once you have found the right one, copy the "_layer" reference for it.
If you are using a geodatabase to host the features then the name will be "[geodatabase name]_[number]"
a shape file will be "[shapefile name]_[number]"
--There are no brackets around this name--

"storymapjump"
Copy "app.maps.[map id].response.map._layers.[layer id].graphic.attributes"
and paste into the Dev console like before, replacing [map id] and [layer id] with the values found in the previous steps.  
This will return a list of the all the items in the layer you selected.
open up the "Object" then "attributes" field to find a list of the attributes for that feature.
find the name of the field that you are using and replace the "storymapjump" in the code
--there are "" around this name--

/*Usage:
       *      Replace [map id] with the UID of the "MAP", not the "story map"
       *      Replace [layer id] with the id of the layer you wish to use to click navigate
       *      Replace "storymapjump" with the field used as the marker on the feature
       *
       *Example:
       *    app.maps.98347aueua73287494aufd.response.map._layers.nav_layer_9435.on("mouse-over",function(e){
       *    app.maps.98347aueua73287494aufd.response.map.setMapCursor("pointer");
       *    });
       *    app.maps.98347aueua73287494aufd.response.map._layers.nav_layer_9435.on("mouse-out",function(e){
       *    app.maps.98347aueua73287494aufd.response.map.setMapCursor("default");
       *    });
       *    app.maps.98347aueua73287494aufd.response.map._layers.nav_layer_9435.on("click",function(e){
       *    var index = e.graphic.attributes["UID"];
       *    topic.publish("story-navigate-section", index);
       *    });
       */
